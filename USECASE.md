SASE Performance Monitoring and Integrations
=====================================
Using ThousandEyes, Meraki, Umbrella, and Webex

There is a need for integration multiple SASE solutions and monitoring performance. It's not easy
to do so in a hybrid workplace. This use case integrates ThousandEyes, Umbrella, and Meraki SD-WAN
with a Webex bot. End-users can self-diagnose by using the bot to create an instant Endpoint Test.
IT Staff can also get the top destinations from Umbrella and use that information to create instant
Enterprise Tests and also change priority in Meraki MX.
